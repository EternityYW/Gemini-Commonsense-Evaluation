Q: an object will sink in what if it's more dense? (A) water (B) gravity (C) calcite (D) wood (E) liquid (F) rain (G) outer space (H) crust. A: An object's density compared to the medium it is in determines whether it will sink or float. If an object is more dense than the medium, it will sink. Water is a common medium for this principle. The answer is: (A). Q: What is a source of drinking water? (A) ice expanding in rock openings (B) helping to prevent floods (C) industrial runoff (D) it helps plants in growing (E) Water seeping out of a spring (F) salt water (G) polluted water (H) Something with a head, thorax, and abdomen. A: Drinking water can come from various sources, including groundwater and springs. Water seeping out of a spring is a natural source of fresh, potable water. The answer is: (E). Q: How does a cactus survive droughts? (A) It becomes dormant (B) It helps them survive (C) roots and shoots (D) high humidity (E) circulatory systems (F) roots to grow (G) Holding water in the stem (H) dormant state. A: Cacti are adapted to arid environments. They store water in their stems to survive long periods of drought. This adaptation allows them to retain water for extended periods. The answer is: (G). Q: What does uneven heating by the Sun cause? (A) harm (B) energy (C) corn (D) Injury (E) cracks (F) wind (G) deadly (H) sweat. A: Uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the sun creates differences in air pressure, leading to wind. Wind is essentially air moving from high to low-pressure areas, caused by this uneven heating. The answer is: (F). Q: What can cause anaphylaxis? (A) hormones (B) skin color (C) lamphreys (D) estrogen (E) whiplash (F) fumes (G) antigen (H) heat.",G,G,G,G
