# [Gemini in Reasoning: Unveiling Commonsense in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17661)

This study conducts a thorough evaluation of Gemini Pro's efficacy in commonsense reasoning tasks, employing a diverse array of datasets that span both language-based and multimodal scenarios.

The official repository contains datasets, model descriptions, the full set of prompts used in experiments, and corresponding experimental results.

## Datasets
We experiment with 12 datasets related to different types of commonsense reasoning, which include 11 language-based datasets and one multimodal dataset.
